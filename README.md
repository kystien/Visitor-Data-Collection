So I originally started this project because I was pissed off with right-wingers using anonymous handles on various social media platforms to spread their garbage. After the attacks on New Zealand on March 15 2019... that event set me off. Reason being is that I read buddies manifesto and everything he said in it was everything that right-wing parties across the world have been spouting for the last decade.

So I got pissed off with one anon handle on twitter and then another and another... It was like they were taunting us. "Oh look at us, we can say whatever the fuck we want without anyone doing shit all to us. Freedom of speech muzzie lovers & faggots!"

And so ya... I embarked on this project in anger and have since come from it with a new sense of respect for the many companies that collect this data daily. Additionally it has given me respect for the authorities that try and collect this data in the coarse of their investigations.

Special note: All data that was collected in my initial testing and public trial has been deleted from all systems, servers and personal devices.
